Collaboration opportunities
- Use FPT as an engineering partner to harden/scale Matchwise: recommender/graph models, “last‑mile” conversational AI, geolocation, and privacy-preserving selective disclosure.
- Enterpriseize deployments (SSO, on‑prem/VPC, SOC2/ISO, data pipelines) via FPT’s cloud/data, low‑code, and managed services.
- White‑label/verticalize Matchwise for FPT clients (BFSI, healthcare, sports) for conferences, partner matchmaking, and internal mentor/talent matching.
- Co-sell through FPT’s global enterprise base and own events; build NVIDIA-backed reference architectures and case studies.
- Localization and multi‑region rollout with cost-optimized infra and support.

Red flags/gaps
- GTM mismatch: SI project work vs Matchwise’s product-led motion.
- IP/brand control and risk of rebuild/replicate.
- Security/compliance demands (SSO, DPIA/DPA, SOC2/ISO) — current status unclear.
- Data privacy/consent in regulated sectors.
- Startup bandwidth to manage a large SI.

Overall synergy rating: 3/5 — Strong build/scale/channel potential, tempered by GTM fit, control, and compliance uncertainties.
