Collaboration opportunities
- Use Ai2’s open OLMo 2 models and Asta agent tooling to power Matchwise’s “last‑mile” conversational matching and RAG, with private/VPC deployment to protect selective‑disclosure data.
- Co-develop and release an open benchmark/dataset for event networking quality, consent-aware matching, and bias/fairness; integrate with AstaBench and co-author a methods paper.
- Run pilots at Ai2/UW community events or workshops to study geolocation-driven, selective‑disclosure networking; publish outcome metrics and case studies.
- Joint research on privacy-preserving profiling, agentic dialogue policies, and safe matching evaluations.

Red flags/gaps
- Mission/GTM mismatch: Ai2 is a non‑profit research lab, not an enterprise buyer or channel.
- Open-first collaboration may pressure Matchwise’s IP/moat.
- Model capability (multilingual, latency) vs closed models is unclear.
- User‑study governance/IRB and data‑sharing overhead.

Overall synergy rating: 3/5 — Strong R&D and open-benchmark fit, but weak commercial/channel alignment.
