Collaboration opportunities
- Pilot Matchwise as the curated networking layer for AC consortium events, industry days, and training cohorts (mentor–mentee, team formation, partner matchmaking).
- Build a “project-to-SDL” matcher: map industry problems to AC lab capabilities and researchers using selective disclosure plus deep research on pubs/patents.
- Joint research on privacy-preserving, ethical AI matching with AC’s AI & Automation and Indigenous Science & Ethical Substance labs; measure outcomes (time-to-team, diversity).
- Leverage AC’s partners (IBM, Nvidia, Merck, BASF, etc.) to scale B2B adoption across scientific conferences; create case studies.

Red flags/gaps
- Mission misalignment: AC’s core is materials R&D, not event-tech.
- Academic procurement, data governance (U of T policies, PIPEDA), IRB needs.
- Possible requirements for Canadian hosting/SSO; unclear if Matchwise supports enterprise SSO/on‑prem.
- Impact limited unless rolled out consortium-wide.

Overall synergy rating: 2/5 — Niche overlap in event/team matchmaking, but core missions and procurement constraints limit fit.
