Collaboration opportunities
- Pilot Matchwise at CAICS/PUT and partner events (public admin, finance/pharma regulators), measuring time-to-match, diversity, and outcomes.
- Co-develop GDPR- and consent-aware selective disclosure, safety, and fairness evals; publish joint papers and run Horizon Europe/NCBR grant bids.
- Apply CAICS anomaly detection/cybersecurity to detect bots, spam, and risky disclosures; build audit trails for regulated events.
- Explore AR/VR-assisted networking (leveraging Meta-funded expertise) for hybrid events.
- Offer EU-resident deployments via Polish partners (e.g., Beyond.pl) and university SSO.

Red flags/gaps
- Academic center: long procurement, limited budgets; not a strong commercial channel.
- Data/ethics governance (GDPR, DPIA/IRB) overhead.
- Need for Polish/EU localization; on‑prem/SSO/security certs for Matchwise are unclear.
- Scope creep into research vs product delivery.

Overall synergy rating: 3/5 — Solid R&D/pilot and EU-compliance fit, but weak direct commercial pathway.
