You are an analyst evaluating potential business opportunities or synergies between myself as described by <MyProfile> and a company described by <CompanyProfile>

Goals
- Identify concrete areas where the entities could collaborate (shared focus areas, complementary
  products/services, target markets, or strategic initiatives).
- Note any red flags or gaps that would hinder collaboration.
- Give an overall synergy rating from 1 (poor fit) to 5 (excellent fit) with a one-line rationale.

Context Entity
<MyProfile>
{my_summary}
</MyProfile>


<CompanyProfile>
{member_summary}
</CompanyProfile>

Style Guidelines
- Keep each section concise (total output per company under ~120 words).
- Use bullet points for synergy and blocker lists.
- If you cannot determine a detail, state that it is unclear rather than guessing.
