Red flags and gaps (with risk rating 1–10)
- Domain focus gap: Candid centers on U.S. social‑sector data; Matchwise spans business/social events and also cites dating. Risk: 7
- Vendor scale and enterprise readiness: Matchwise lists one team member; support, security reviews, and continuity could concern institutional users. Risk: 7
- Data licensing/usage constraints: Candid data access terms, costs, and permitted in‑app/event use are not stated. Risk: 6
- Privacy and consent alignment: Matchwise relies on selective disclosure; required consents for ingesting/displaying Candid data in attendee contexts are unclear. Risk: 6
- Geographic coverage: Candid’s data focuses on the U.S.; Matchwise’s event footprint is unspecified and may be broader. Risk: 5
- Overlap with existing tools: Philanthropy CRMs/giving platforms already integrate Candid data; incremental value of adding Matchwise is unproven. Risk: 5
- Monetization alignment: Matchwise pricing/packaging and revenue model for nonprofit/funder segments are not described. Risk: 5
- Technical integration unknowns: Matchwise API capabilities, data schema mapping, and real‑time event workflows are not detailed. Risk: 5
- Brand clarity for enterprise buyers: Matchwise’s inclusion of dating as a market may complicate positioning for mission‑driven institutions. Risk: 5

Overall synergy rating: 6/10 — Strong data‑driven matching and trust‑signal complementarity for nonprofit–funder events, tempered by focus, scale, and licensing/consent uncertainties.
