Below is a concise, research-driven profile of the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), compiled from a crawl of allenai.org and key internal pages.

Organization summary
- Identity and mission: The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) is a Seattle-based nonprofit AI research institute founded in 2014 by Paul G. Allen. Its mission is “Building breakthrough AI to solve the world’s biggest problems.”
- Core focus areas:
  - Open models: OLMo 2, a family of fully open language models trained with open data, open training code, reproducible recipes, transparent evaluations, and intermediate checkpoints.
  - Agentic AI for science: Asta—an ecosystem combining agents for complex research tasks, AstaBench (rigorous agent benchmarks and leaderboards), and developer resources/APIs for building and testing scientific AI agents.
  - AI for the planet: Open platforms and models that turn multi-sensor and planetary data into decision-ready insights for climate, agriculture/food security, wildfire management, and biodiversity/ecosystem protection (e.g., OlmoEarth platform).
  - Embodied AI: Open research and simulation-driven training for intelligent robotics and 3D reasoning.
- Open-first research principles and values: Emphasis on true openness (beyond open source), rigorous and reproducible science, focused investments in high-impact work, and deep collaboration with partners and the broader community.
- Leadership and governance:
  - CEO: Ali Farhadi.
  - Board: Jody Allen; Ed Lazowska (UW Paul G. Allen School). Scientific advisory board includes Adam Cheyer, David Forsyth, Eric Horvitz, Mirella Lapata, Tom Mitchell, Aude Oliva, and Dan Roth.
- Team and programs:
  - 200+ employees with multidisciplinary backgrounds.
  - Talent programs: Young Investigators (postdoc), Pre-doctoral Young Investigators, and internships (with a strong open research/output culture).
  - Most roles are Seattle-based; international candidates welcomed (visa sponsorship supported).
- Partnerships and ecosystem:
  - University of Washington (Paul G. Allen School): foundational and applied research collaboration.
  - National Science Foundation: supports an Open Multimodal AI Infrastructure to Accelerate Science (national-level fully open AI ecosystem).
  - Google Cloud: supports development of open models and AI platforms, including planetary modeling/insights.
- Notable releases and milestones:
  - OLMo 2 32B: a fully open model family member trained up to 6T tokens and post-trained with Tulu 3.1; Ai2 states it is the first fully open model to outperform GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini on a suite of popular, multi-skill academic benchmarks.
  - Tülu 3: an open post-training recipe (prompt curation & synthesis, supervised finetuning, preference tuning with off-/on-policy data, RL-based skill rewards) used for instruction-following and capability boosts.
  - Asta and AstaBench: agentic research platform and rigorous evaluation framework/leaderboards for scientific agents.
  - OlmoEarth platform: open, end-to-end infrastructure to transform Earth observation data into operational insights.
  - Reported funding: combined $152M award from NSF and NVIDIA to build a national-level, fully open AI ecosystem (as announced on the Ai2 blog).
- Target audiences and beneficiaries:
  - Researchers and developers (academia and industry) seeking open models, training data, code, evaluation tools, and benchmarks.
  - Scientific and environmental stakeholders (e.g., climate and wildlife managers, agriculture).
  - Robotics researchers focusing on embodied intelligence and 3D reasoning.

Especially distinctive aspects
- “Truly open” end-to-end model development (OLMo 2) with open data, training code, recipes, checkpoints, and evaluation tooling—designed for rigorous scientific reproduction.
- Asta: unified agentic ecosystem for scientific research, including agent assistants, benchmarks with leaderboards (AstaBench), and developer resources/APIs.
- Planetary-scale AI: open platforms (e.g., OlmoEarth) aimed at translating multisensor Earth data into actionable insights for climate, wildfire, agriculture, and conservation.
- Large-scale public funding and partnerships: blog-announced combined $152M from NSF and NVIDIA; deep collaborations with University of Washington and Google Cloud.
- Multidisciplinary governance and scientific advisory leadership, combining academic, industry, and open research expertise.
