Here’s a concise summary of the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), based on information crawled from its website.

- The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) is a Seattle-based non-profit AI research institute founded in 2014 by Paul G. Allen, with a mission of “building breakthrough AI to solve the world’s biggest problems.”  
- Ai2 advances open AI through flagship efforts including OLMo (a fully open family of language models; OLMo 2 provides open data, code, training recipes, and evaluations, with a 32B model trained up to 6T tokens they report outperforming GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini on academic benchmarks) and Asta (an agentic ecosystem featuring research agents, AstaBench leaderboards, and developer resources), alongside work in embodied robotics and AI for planetary challenges.  
- The organization serves researchers and developers by releasing open models, datasets, benchmarks, and tools, and collaborates with partners such as the University of Washington, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and Google Cloud; a recent blog post highlights a combined $152M award from NSF and NVIDIA to build a fully open national AI ecosystem.  
- Ai2 lists its headquarters at 3800 Latona Ave NE, Seattle, WA, emphasizes “true openness” (releasing model weights, training data, code, and evaluations), and offers multiple research programs and roles via its careers pipeline.
