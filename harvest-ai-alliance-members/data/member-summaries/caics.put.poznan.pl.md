Here’s a concise profile of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity (CAICS) at Poznan University of Technology.

CAICS is an academic center in Poznań, Poland focused on research, R&D projects, and capability-building in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, acting as a contact point for public administration and industry. Its competencies span system security (IoT, networks, big data, unmanned vehicle comms), ML for anomaly detection, multi‑modal data integration and data lakes, AI for medical imaging and disease risk, energy consumption modeling, text/sentiment/fake‑news analysis, autonomous systems and robotics (including sustainable agriculture), and emotion recognition. The center is a member of the AI Alliance and has signed letters of intent with institutions including Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), the Main Pharmaceutical Inspectorate, Łukasiewicz–PIT, Beyond.pl, multiple universities (Lodz, Silesian, Cracow, American University Kyiv, Medical University of Bialystok, University of Economics in Katowice), and others; implemented projects include Meta‑funded AR/VR initiatives (ARPresence and rehabilitation with the Medical University of Poznań). Leadership is noted as Dr. Eng. Robert Wrembel, Prof. PP, and recent activity includes participation in a generative AI roundtable at the U.S. Ambassador’s residence with IBM and university leadership.
