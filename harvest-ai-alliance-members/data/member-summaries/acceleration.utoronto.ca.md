**Acceleration Consortium (AC)** is a global centre based at the University of Toronto that unites government, academia, and industry to accelerate the discovery and commercialization of advanced materials and molecules using “self-driving labs” (AI, robotics, and high-throughput, closed-loop experimentation). It operates six open-core SDLs at U of T plus a scale-up SDL at the University of British Columbia, supported by specialized labs (AI & Automation, L‑MOST, Indigenous Science & Ethical Substance), and has access to 30+ additional SDLs worldwide. Backed by a $200M Canada First Research Excellence Fund (2023), the AC reports 35+ staff scientists and 75+ faculty, targeting applications in health, energy, electronics, green products, and construction; it also runs training and grant programs to build workforce capacity. The AC notes SDLs can cut development from roughly 20 years/$100M to as little as one year/$1M, and recent highlights include a Science paper on delocalized, closed-loop discovery of organic laser emitters and grants advancing lipid nanoparticle discovery and social-science research on AI-driven science. Notable partners include Merck KGaA (Darmstadt), Genentech, BASF, IBM, Nvidia, Meta, Unilever, NIST, National Research Council Canada, Mitacs, Vector Institute, CIFAR, and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory.
