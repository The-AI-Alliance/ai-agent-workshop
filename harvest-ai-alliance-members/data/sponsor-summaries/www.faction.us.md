Here’s an authoritative distillation based on Faction’s website.

Faction Technology is a South San Francisco–based company building a supervised driverless platform for right-sized, electric micro‑EV fleets used in last‑mile delivery and vehicle on‑demand services. Its end‑to‑end Driverless Vehicle Platform combines onboard safety‑critical autonomy with DriveLink (digital vehicle platform with OTA updates) and TeleAssist, a trajectory‑based remote assistance system, plus cloud fleet management, APIs, and customer apps that integrate with fulfillment/order systems. The company emphasizes pragmatic, cost‑effective deployments in controlled commercial environments across airfields, grocery, fast food, and delivery fleet use cases; recent updates include self‑driving light‑EV testing in Houston (2024), funding led by TDK Ventures, and partnerships/collaborations with NVIDIA (Inception), Arcimoto, ElectraMeccanica, and GoCar Tours. Founded in 2020, Faction states its team has prior AV milestones, including early commercial deployments (2018) and driverless highway operations without a safety driver (2019).
