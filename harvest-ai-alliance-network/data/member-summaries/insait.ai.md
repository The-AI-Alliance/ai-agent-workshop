## INSAIT — Organization Summary

INSAIT (Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology) is a research institute based in Sofia, Bulgaria, dedicated to advancing computer science, AI, and technology through excellence in science, research, and education. Founded and led scientifically by Prof. Martin Vechev, INSAIT’s mission emphasizes an immersive research environment that fosters creativity, curiosity-driven exploration, and freedom of thought to develop world-changing technologies (Mission).

INSAIT operates within the European Union, leveraging Horizon Europe instruments (e.g., ERC grants) and a growing regional tech ecosystem. It is part of Sofia University “St. Kliment Ohridski,” and actively collaborates with global academic and industry partners. The institute’s location in Sofia offers EU access, strong informatics/mathematics talent pipelines, and proximity to major tech R&D centers.

Core research spans:
- Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Natural Language Processing
- Quantum Computing; Cyber Security; Automated Reasoning; Formal Methods
- Computer Systems & Networks; Programming Languages; Algorithms & Theory; Data Management

Its faculty and mentors include leading researchers affiliated with ETH Zurich, EPFL, CMU, and Google, among others. INSAIT has achieved notable visibility at premier conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICCV, IROS) and releases open research contributions.

Notable partnerships and milestones:
- Google partnership expanded with over $2M in support, including cloud compute and ~$1M in PhD fellowships; earlier $1M contribution also announced (News).
- Europe’s first open robotic foundation model trained on 3D data (SPEAR-1), achieving state-of-the-art results with up to 20× less data (News).
- Collaboration with ETH Zurich on qblaze, a state-of-the-art quantum simulator setting a new benchmark by factoring the largest number to date using Shor’s algorithm (News).
- Historic Bulgarian presence at top venues: 7 NeurIPS 2023 papers (first in Bulgaria’s history), 14 ICCV 2025 papers, and multiple IROS 2025 acceptances (News).
- Joint work with Google DeepMind on the “Physics-IQ” benchmark to assess physical reasoning in video models (News).

Stakeholders include prospective and current faculty, PhD students and researchers, and industry collaborators. INSAIT promotes research–industry interaction and offers a compelling environment for international scholars, supported by EU programs, local cost advantages, and international schools in Sofia (About).

Distinctive aspects:
- First-of-its-kind AI/computer science research institute in Eastern Europe with top-tier global mentors.
- Strong, ongoing partnerships with industry leaders (notably Google) and elite universities (ETH Zurich), with tangible outputs (open models, benchmarks, and systems).
- Rapid research impact and visibility at premier AI/CS venues, positioning Bulgaria as a rising AI destination.
