## Mass Open Cloud (MOC) Alliance — Organization Overview

The Mass Open Cloud (MOC) Alliance is a collaborative, open production research-focused cloud initiative that aims to accelerate discovery and innovation by closely integrating research, development, and operations across academia, medical research centers, government, and industry. The Alliance’s core mission is to provide predictable, low-cost computing resources and facilitator support for domain researchers while advancing open cloud innovation.

Key initiatives and services
- New England Research Cloud (NERC): A regional, on‑premise cloud resource available to research and education users. NERC provides suites of cloud services (e.g., OpenStack, OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Science) designed for agility, scalability, and data control/security.
  - Pricing: Published rates are approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of commercial public cloud pricing and include no egress fees; rates are expected to decrease as the service scales.
  - Onboarding and documentation: Users can find onboarding steps, service documentation, and tutorials, including hands-on demos (e.g., running LLAMA‑2 on GPU VMs, GitOps pipelines with OpenShift, and MLOps workflows on RHODS).
  - Promotions: One month of free service (or up to $1,000) is offered; Boston University Research IT additionally offers $100/month subsidies for BU faculty.
- Open, collaborative structure: The MOC Alliance invites industry partners to co-develop organizational principles, governance, and broader contributor engagement, leveraging past successes with core partners (e.g., Red Hat, Two Sigma).

Partnerships and ecosystem
- Lenovo partnership: The MOC Alliance announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration leveraging Lenovo TruScale GPU as a Service to establish a GPU cluster, improving access to high-performance GPU resources for universities.
- Academic and infrastructure partners: Boston University, Northeastern University, the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), UMass, and others are listed among current partners and contributors, alongside technology companies (e.g., Cisco, Mellanox).

Target users and impact
- Primary audience: Academic research and education communities seeking reliable, cost-predictable cloud infrastructure with facilitator support.
- Broader effects: While focused on academic communities, MOC Alliance projects can influence commercial cloud practices, serving as a “launching pad” for broader-scale innovations.

Notable differentiators
- Open production research cloud model enabling close research–operations collaboration.
- Regional, cost-conscious cloud (NERC) with no egress fees and tutorials usefully targeted at practical research workloads (e.g., LLMs, CI/CD GitOps, MLOps).
- Strong multi-stakeholder governance and industry engagement model, with structured pathways for organizations to contribute and guide strategy.
