## MLOps Community — Organization Overview

The MLOps Community is a practitioner-led organization focused on sharing real‑world Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) best practices from engineers in the field. Recognizing that MLOps differs significantly from DevOps, the community provides a dedicated forum to address the unique challenges of building, deploying, and operating production AI/ML pipelines. It is open to everyone and encourages knowledge sharing through discussions, events, and published content.

Core focus and offerings
- Knowledge sharing: A community space to “share knowledge, ask questions, get answers” on the day‑to‑day realities of MLOps, distinct from broader DevOps practices.
- Events and meetups: Regular meetups and themed events (e.g., “Agentic MLOps,” LLM Ops) featuring short talks and networking. Example: an April 2025 meetup sponsored and hosted by AWS.
- Content publishing: A blog with frequent posts covering practical topics such as LLM training, evaluation, pipeline testing, AI agent security, and applied tooling, authored by practitioners.

Audience and participation
- Target audience: ML engineers, data scientists, platform engineers, and practitioners responsible for productionizing machine learning systems.
- Community access: Open membership with options to participate via Slack, attend or speak at meetups, and contribute articles.

Support and ecosystem
- Sponsors: Backed by a broad set of industry sponsors including Tecton, Weights & Biases, QuantumBlack, AWS, NVIDIA, Zilliz, Databricks, Donut, SAS, Union.ai, Aporia, Arize, Petuum, Wallaroo, Snorkel, and Qwak, among others.
- Geographic scope: Global community with online presence and in‑person meetups hosted with sponsor support.

Distinctive aspects
- Practitioner‑driven, vendor‑agnostic focus on the “real‑world” operational challenges of ML systems.
- Active ecosystem support from major ML/AI infrastructure and tooling companies.
- Regular, topical meetups and a living knowledge base via the community blog and Slack.
