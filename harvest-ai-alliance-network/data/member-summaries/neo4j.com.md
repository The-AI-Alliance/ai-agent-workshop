## Neo4j — Company Overview

Neo4j is the market leader in graph technology, providing a native graph database platform and graph data science tooling used to transform connected data into knowledge for deep, contextual understanding. Founded by Emil Eifrem, Johan Svensson, and Peter Neubauer (with the first prototype originating in 2000), the company open sourced the first graph database under the GPL in 2007, released Neo4j 1.0 in 2010, and moved its headquarters to Silicon Valley in 2011. Today, thousands of organizations — from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises — use Neo4j to power use cases like recommendations, fraud detection, master data management, identity and access management, content management, portfolio and risk, network impact analysis, and real-time logistics routing.
