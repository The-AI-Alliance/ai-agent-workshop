## OpenUK — Organization Overview

OpenUK is the UK’s open technology industry body dedicated to “the business of open technology.” It convenes the country’s business, academic, and contributor communities across open source software, open hardware, open data, open standards, and AI. Operated with a strong volunteer base, OpenUK delivers its mission through three pillars: Community; Legal & Policy; and Learning.

What OpenUK does
- Convening and recognition
  - Runs one of the world’s leading recognition programs in open tech, including the OpenUK Awards (the “Oscars of Open Source”), New Year’s Honours Lists, and an Ambassador Scheme.
  - Organizes State of Open Con, which since launching in 2023 has become a leading open source conference (2025 target: ~1,000 attendees, 8 tracks + plenary, 50+ partners in the delegate space, and 200+ speakers) [About Us].
- Research and reporting
  - Publishes the annual “State of Open” reports, and conducts commissioned research (case studies, thought leadership, surveys, desk research).  
  - Hosts “Research and Reporting Show & Tell” sessions to connect and update the global open source research community; launching an OpenUK Fellows Network (postgraduate researchers) to expand academic research across “the opens” [About Us].
- Policy leadership
  - Serves as a holistic, representative voice across the UK’s “open” ecosystem; engages with policymakers using a volunteer Policy Advisory Board and subject-matter experts from across multiple Advisory Boards (AI, Communications Tech, Data, Finance, Hardware, Healthcare, Security, Software, Space, Sustainability, Quantum).  
  - Leads policy conversations on open source licensing and commercialization, AI openness, cloud computing, and emerging topics; second organization worldwide established with open source policy as its core purpose [About Us].
- Skills and learning
  - Delivers programs like Kids Camps (coding, open source, sustainability) and founder training covering the business of open source; has shared hundreds of hours of digital training.  
  - Ambitions include a UK apprenticeship module and advocating for open source in the UK curriculum [About Us].
- Sustainability and strategic initiatives
  - Day-one member of Gaia-X and the UK’s Gaia-X Hub Coordinator; hosted a major tech event at COP26; first open tech organization to adopt a dedicated Sustainability Policy and appoint a Chief Sustainability Officer [About Us].

Funding and participation
- OpenUK is funded by individual Supporters and Partners’ donations and sponsorships. Supporters pay a small monthly subscription (suggested £5/month; minimum £3/month) and receive benefits like priority event access, supporter-only updates/events, mentoring opportunities, and the ability to vote in Board elections [Become a Supporter].
- Participation in OpenUK committees, workgroups, and events is open to all, subject to the OpenUK Code of Respect and Competition Policy [Homepage].

Positioning and audience
- Serves UK businesses, academic institutions, maintainers/contributors, and policymakers working in open software, hardware, data, standards, and AI.
- Operates as the UK’s central convening point for open tech communities, while engaging internationally through research, policy outreach, and alliances like Gaia-X.

Notable differentiators
- A uniquely holistic scope spanning all “opens” (software, hardware, data, standards, AI) and connecting policy, community, research, and education in one organization [About Us].
- Early and visible leadership in sustainability within open tech (Sustainability Policy, CSO; COP26 presence) [About Us].
- Rapid growth and ambition in events and research (State of Open Con scale targets; Fellows Network) [About Us].
