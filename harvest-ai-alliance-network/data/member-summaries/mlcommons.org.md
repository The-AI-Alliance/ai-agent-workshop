## MLCommons — Organization Overview

MLCommons is an open artificial intelligence (AI) engineering consortium that develops neutral, industry‑standard benchmarks, datasets, and tools to improve the accuracy, safety, speed, and efficiency of AI systems. Through collective engineering with more than 125 global members and affiliates—spanning startups, large companies, academia, and non‑profits—MLCommons measures and advances AI quality, performance, and risk, helping organizations build trusted, safe, and efficient AI.

Core focus and activities
- Open benchmarks (MLPerf): MLCommons designs and maintains widely used, neutral benchmarks that quantify AI accuracy, speed, and efficiency across training, inference, HPC, mobile, tinyML, and more—enabling consistent comparisons and better engineering decisions.
- AI Risk & Reliability: A working group comprising industry, research, and civil society experts building tools, tests, and a platform toward a harmonized approach for safer AI, with the aim to standardize safety assessment.
- Data & research: MLCommons builds open, large‑scale, diverse datasets and tools that improve AI reproducibility and reliability, including the Croissant metadata vocabulary (adopted by 700k+ datasets). Shared research infrastructure supports the AI community’s scientific breakthroughs.

Mission, principles, and community
- Mission: Accelerate AI innovation and increase its positive impact on society by democratizing machine learning through open benchmarks and open data at scale.
- Principles: Grow AI markets for societal benefit; be global, inclusive, and fair; act through collaborative engineering; make fast consensus‑supported decisions; and build a community people want to join.
- Membership/community: 125+ members and affiliates, with 10 benchmark suites and 89,700+ MLPerf performance results to date.

History and milestones
- 2018–2020: Launches of MLPerf Training, HPC, Inference, Mobile, and TinyML; publication of first benchmark results; creation of MLCube; kickoff and expansion of People’s Speech dataset; MLCommons officially launched in Dec 2020.
- 2023: Launch of the AI Risk & Reliability working group to develop safety benchmarks, tools, and a platform for safer AI.

Leadership and location
- Governance: A board of directors drawn from the MLCommons community provides strategic guidance and ensures accountability and transparency.
- Address: MLCommons, 8 The Green #20930, Dover, DE 19901, USA.

Target users and industries
- AI/ML practitioners across industry and academia: hardware and software vendors, research labs, startups, cloud providers, and application builders who rely on open, reproducible measurement and data standards to develop reliable AI systems.

Distinctive aspects
- Neutral, open standards and benchmarks (MLPerf) widely adopted across the AI ecosystem.
- A comprehensive approach that spans performance measurement, data standardization (e.g., Croissant), and AI safety/risk assessment via a dedicated working group.
- Large, diverse, and active consortium enabling cross‑sector collaboration and rapid, consensus‑driven iteration.
