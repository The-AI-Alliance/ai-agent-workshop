## OpenMined — Organization Overview

OpenMined is a 501(c)(3) non-profit foundation and mission‑driven community focused on unlocking access to non‑public data for AI in a privacy‑preserving and rights‑respecting way. It develops open‑source technologies and frameworks to enable safe, trustworthy, and responsible AI by allowing data owners to retain control while researchers and developers compute over distributed datasets without centralization.

Core focus and approach
- Attribution‑Based Control (ABC): OpenMined’s primary technical paradigm to restore source‑level attribution and dynamic control in AI systems. ABC is proposed as a way to mitigate major risks (privacy, copyright, value alignment, bias/governance, hallucinations, concentration of power) by reducing “addition and copying” in AI algorithms and enabling controlled, attributable influence of data, compute, and talent on each prediction.
- Privacy‑preserving collaboration: OpenMined builds and maintains open‑source protocols and software that let organizations run analytics and train models across institutional boundaries while keeping data at the source and under the owner’s consent.

Key products and initiatives
- SyftBox (Beta): An open‑source protocol for building, deploying, and federating privacy‑preserving computations across a decentralized network. It is language‑agnostic, modular, and designed for secure data storage/management. Use cases include training AI models over distributed data, running secure analytics without raw‑data access, cross‑organization collaboration without trust assumptions, and enabling individuals to contribute data while retaining ownership and consent. (Deploy at syftbox.net.)
- ABC Initiative: A comprehensive effort to synthesize techniques from deep learning, cryptography, and distributed systems into practical ABC‑enabled AI systems. The goal is to unlock orders of magnitude more accessible data and compute while maintaining source‑level attribution and control.
- NAIRR Pilot Partnership: OpenMined participates in the U.S. National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot, offering privacy‑preserving infrastructure (including Syft), training, and support to help research consortia access and work with far more data (claim: “1000x more”) while protecting sensitive information. The program targets collaborations across healthcare, finance, government, and other sectors with non‑public datasets.

Target users and industries
- Researchers and research consortia (e.g., universities, national labs) needing to analyze sensitive or distributed data.
- Data engineers and developers building privacy‑preserving applications without specialized PETs expertise.
- Businesses and institutions that must collaborate on data‑driven projects (healthcare, financial services, public sector) while retaining strict control over data.
- Individuals interested in contributing data to research/AI without sacrificing privacy.

Community and scale indicators
- Mission‑driven community of 16,000+ engineers and researchers (as referenced in the NAIRR program page).
- Positioning: “AI is trained and evaluated on less than 0.01% of the world’s data” — OpenMined’s work aims to remove privacy, security, legal, and IP barriers that prevent responsible access to non‑public data.

Distinctive aspects
- A principled, technical framework (ABC) explicitly addressing attribution and control in AI predictions — intended to realign incentives and enable safe use of sensitive data at scale.
- Open‑source, network‑first architecture enabling decentralized computations and consent‑centric data collaboration (SyftBox).
- Active role in major democratization initiatives (NAIRR pilot), enabling researchers to work with sensitive datasets without violating privacy or ownership.
- Focus on turning recent advances in deep learning, cryptography, and distributed systems into practical, production‑grade protocols and software.

Regions served and legal status
- Global community; incorporated as a U.S. 501(c)(3) public charity.

### Most Relevant Data Points (for quick reference)
- Organization: OpenMined (non‑profit 501(c)(3), mission‑driven community).
- Core mission: Enable privacy‑preserving, controllable access to non‑public data for AI; make AI safer, more trustworthy, and more responsible.
- Key paradigm: Attribution‑Based Control (ABC) — source‑level attribution and dynamic control for data, compute, and talent influencing AI predictions.
- Flagship protocol: SyftBox (Beta), an open‑source, language‑agnostic protocol to federate privacy‑preserving computations across a decentralized network.
- NAIRR pilot partner: Provides PET infrastructure (e.g., Syft), training, and support; target outcomes include enabling research consortia to access “1000x more data” while keeping data at the source.
- Target users/industries: Researchers, data engineers, and institutions (healthcare, finance, government) needing cross‑institution analysis on sensitive data.
- Community scale: 16,000+ engineers and researchers (NAIRR page).
- Stated challenge: AI currently trained/evaluated on <0.01% of global data due to privacy/security/legal/IP barriers — OpenMined aims to fix this.
- Notable claims: ABC aims to reduce risks (privacy, copyright, value alignment, governance bias, hallucinations, concentration of power) by minimizing “addition/copying” operations and retaining attribution/control.
