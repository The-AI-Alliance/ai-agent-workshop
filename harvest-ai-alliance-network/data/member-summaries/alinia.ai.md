## Alinia AI — Company Overview

Alinia AI is an enterprise platform focused on safe, compliant, and reliable deployment of generative AI. The company provides multilingual guardrails, evaluation, and monitoring tools that reduce hallucinations, enforce policy and regulatory compliance, and give organizations full visibility over GenAI activity. Its offering targets high-stakes, regulated use cases (e.g., finance, healthcare), enabling engineering, legal, and governance teams to configure domain-specific controls, create compliance metrics, and generate regulation-informed reports.

Core business and value proposition
- Builds an AI alignment and governance platform for enterprises to enforce compliance at scale, reduce risks, and control model behavior across models and hosting platforms.
- Offers guardrails that detect hallucinations and irrelevance in RAG-based applications, evaluated across six languages and benchmarked against industry leaders.
- Provides end-to-end capabilities: evaluation (evidence-based alignment to business policies and KPIs), guardrails (safety/compliance controls), and monitoring (visibility into prompts, outputs, and system activity with reporting).

Key products and capabilities
- Alinia RAG Guard: Model for detecting hallucinations and irrelevance in RAG pipelines; benchmarked against GPT-4o-mini, IBM Granite, and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, with up to 40% performance improvement in reducing errors; strong results in short-context and domain-specific scenarios (finance, healthcare) and validated on large-scale, realistic datasets (e.g., RAGBench with 100,000 samples).
- Evaluation Engine and Monitoring: Evidence-based assessments, adversarial testing, and intelligible reporting (internal QA and external AI compliance). 100% visibility to inspect every prompt and output.
- Governance and Compliance: Create organization-specific compliance metrics and control agents; generate regulation-informed reporting; boost AI legal red teaming productivity.
- Guardrails for Agentic Systems: Safety layers across memory, reasoning, environment interaction, and action execution; enforce human-in-the-loop control for irreversible or sensitive actions; PII detection, jailbreak detection, and business rule enforcement.

Target customers and industries
- Enterprises deploying GenAI (chatbots, copilots, QA systems, and agentic workflows), particularly in regulated and high-stakes domains (finance, healthcare).
- Multilingual environments (English, Spanish, Italian, French, German, Catalan).

Mission and approach
- Mission: Enable safe, controlled deployments of generative AI for enterprises, guided by their policies and business preferences, with humans retaining ultimate control.
- Approach: State-of-the-art evaluation and optimization, plus configurable guardrails and monitoring to ensure trust, safety, and regulatory compliance at scale.

Leadership and notable milestones
- Founders: CEO Ariadna (Ari) Font Llitjós (former Head of ML Platform at Twitter; former Director of Development at IBM Watson; PhD in NLP from Carnegie Mellon University) and COO Carlos Muñoz Ferrandis (led governance processes for LLMs at Hugging Face; active in EU AI Act discussions).
- Funding: $2.4M pre-seed led by Speedinvest and Precursor Ventures, with participation from KFund and prominent angels (e.g., Oriol Vinyals, Clem Delangue, Thom Wolf, Xavier Amatriain, Tom Preston-Werner, Miguel Martinez).
- Ecosystem: Member of the AI Alliance, participating in Trust & Safety and Advocacy working groups.

Distinctive aspects
- Demonstrated performance: Up to 40% better error reduction vs. leading alternatives; 25%+ improvement in short-context scenarios; e.g., 57% improvement in response relevance and 51% improvement in groundedness vs. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.
- Multilingual guardrails tested across six languages and domain-specific datasets for finance and healthcare.
- Comprehensive governance tooling: Create compliance metrics, run adversarial tests, produce regulation-informed reports, and gain full prompt/output observability.
- Safety for agentic systems: Layered guardrails that block unsafe or irreversible actions, detect PII exposure and jailbreak attempts, and enforce business-specific policies.
