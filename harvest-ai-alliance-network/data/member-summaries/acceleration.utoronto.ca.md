Here is a distilled profile of the Acceleration Consortium (AC), based on an internal crawl of acceleration.utoronto.ca.

Organization summary
- What they do: The Acceleration Consortium is a global, University of Toronto–based research consortium that accelerates the discovery, design, and translation of new materials and molecules using self-driving labs (SDLs)—closed-loop systems that combine AI, robotics/automation, high-throughput experimentation, and advanced computing to autonomously design–make–test materials.
- Core focus and mission: “There is no time for science as usual.” AC aims to dramatically shorten materials discovery timelines and costs while advancing ethical, inclusive innovation. Its program integrates technical research with ethics, economics, equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI), and Indigenous science to ensure responsible impact.
- Distinctive value proposition:
  - Claims SDLs can reduce development from ~20 years and $100M to as little as ~1 year and $1M.
  - Houses one of the world’s largest coordinated SDL efforts: 6 SDLs at the University of Toronto and 1 at the University of British Columbia (UBC), with open core facilities and access to 30+ additional SDLs globally via members/partners.
  - Received a $200M Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF) award (2023) to expand capacity, including renovations at U of T’s Lash Miller building.
- Facilities and scale:
  - SDLs span: AI & Automation (SDL0); Inorganic (SDL1); Organic (SDL2); Medicinal Chemistry (SDL3); Polymers (SDL4); Formulations (SDL5); Human Organ Mimicry (SDL6); and Scale-up at UBC (SDL7).
  - Support labs include: AI & Automation; Lab for the Management of Science and Technology (L-MOST); Indigenous Science and Ethical Substance Lab (ISES); and a Training Lab for hands-on upskilling.
  - Led by more than 35 staff scientists and a cohort of over 75 faculty.
- Target applications/industries:
  - Health (therapeutics, drug delivery, anti-viral coatings)
  - Transportation/Construction (alloys, cement)
  - Energy (renewables, batteries, storage)
  - Green products (biodegradable plastics/fibres)
  - Electronics (LEDs, wearables)
  - Novel materials classes that enable new industries
- Who they serve:
  - A consortium of government, principal investigators/academia, and industry (including large enterprises, startups/SMEs, investors, and research organizations).
  - Partners can access SDLs, expert consultations, collaborative/direct research, residency and training, professional development, a talent pipeline, and leveraged internships.
- Notable partnerships (selection): IBM, NVIDIA, Meta, Merck KGaA (Darmstadt), Genentech, Amgen, BASF, Solvay, Unilever, NIST, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Vector Institute, CIFAR, Creative Destruction Lab, SGC, Mitacs, NRC Canada, Natural Resources Canada, UHN, UBC, McMaster, University of Montreal, Ivado, BIG-MAP, Molecule Maker Lab Institute, Materials Innovation Factory.
- Leadership: Led by Alán Aspuru-Guzik (AC Director and U of T Professor).
- Programs and training:
  - Grants: Accelerate Grant Program; AC Social Science & Humanities Research Grants; EDI Initiate Grants; Caregiver Grants.
  - National training: CREATE for Accelerated Discovery.
  - Micro-credentials via U of T: Autonomous Systems Discovery.
  - AC-SURP (summer undergraduate research) for equity-deserving students.
- Recent announcements/highlights:
  - Science publication demonstrating global leadership in SDLs: “Delocalized, Asynchronous, Closed-Loop Discovery of Organic Laser Emitters.”
  - Inaugural social science grants on implications of AI/automation in science.
  - Accelerate Translation Grant leveraging SDLs for lipid nanoparticle discovery (mRNA therapies).
- Regions and footprint:
  - Based at the University of Toronto with additional scale-up capacity at the University of British Columbia; engages a global network of partners and SDLs.
- Careers:
  - Active recruitment for research and technical roles (e.g., lab technicians for Human Organ Mimicry SDL, software engineers for lab automation/connectors, research associates/postdocs/graduate trainees), with rolling intakes for trainees.
- Contact:
  - Partnerships: Padraic Foley, Director, Strategy and Partnerships (padraic.foley@utoronto.ca)
  - Media: Erin Warner, Director, Marketing and Communications (erin.warner@utoronto.ca)

Especially distinctive aspects
- Large-scale, open-core SDL infrastructure across multiple material classes and modalities, including a dedicated scale-up SDL.
- Quantified acceleration claim: from ~20 years/$100M to ~1 year/$1M for materials development.
- Significant federal funding: $200M CFREF (2023) enabling rapid capacity growth.
- Integration of ethical, EDI, and Indigenous science research directly into accelerated discovery programs.
- Broad, high-profile industry and public-sector partnerships spanning AI, pharma/biotech, chemicals, consumer goods, and government labs.
