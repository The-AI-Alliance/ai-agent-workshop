## NumFOCUS — Organization Overview

NumFOCUS is a U.S. 501(c)(3) public charity that promotes open practices in research, data, and scientific computing. It serves as a fiscal sponsor and stable, independent home for many of the world’s most widely used open-source scientific software projects, and organizes community-driven educational programs to advance accessible, reproducible science.

Core mission and vision
- Mission: Promote open practices in research, data, and scientific computing by fiscally sponsoring open-source projects and organizing community-driven educational programs. 
- Vision: An inclusive scientific and research community that uses actively supported open-source software to make impactful discoveries for a better world.

What NumFOCUS does
- Fiscal Sponsorship & Project Support
  - Provides financial stewardship, operational stability, and administrative support for open-source scientific projects so they can focus on development and community.
  - Sponsors dozens of flagship projects across the scientific data stack, including (examples) NumPy, pandas, Project Jupyter, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn, Julia, Dask, xarray, NetworkX, Astropy, SymPy, Bokeh, GDAL, ITK, Cantera, Stan, and more.
  - Encourages projects that are scientifically oriented, interoperable, and part of wider ecosystems; supports software and non-software projects that advance scientific computing.
- Programs & Community
  - PyData: NumFOCUS’s flagship educational program—a global network of community events and resources that facilitate sharing of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies in data management, analytics, and visualization (Python, Julia, R, and beyond). Proceeds benefit NumFOCUS and its mission.
  - Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC): Guidance and programming to promote diversity and inclusion within open-source data science communities.
