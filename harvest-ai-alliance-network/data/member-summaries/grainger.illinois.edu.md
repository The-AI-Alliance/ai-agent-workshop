## Summary of The Grainger College of Engineering (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)

The Grainger College of Engineering is the engineering and computing college of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, focused on top-tier education, high-impact research, and public engagement. It offers comprehensive undergraduate, graduate, and online programs across core engineering disciplines and computing, and it operates one of the largest, best-ranked engineering portfolios in the United States (e.g., U.S. News undergraduate program ranked #5 overall; graduate program #7; online master’s #2 overall) [Facts & Rankings; About].

Its core mission is to “build a better tomorrow” by training expert engineers and advancing solutions to global challenges such as clean energy, climate and sustainability, health, security, and advanced computing. Research is organized across major themes including Climate & Sustainability, Energy Transitions (e.g., micro nuclear, hydrogen, electrification), and Quantum (information, computing, networking, sensing) [Research Areas]. The college supports entrepreneurship through the Technology Entrepreneur Center and extensive corporate engagement, connecting research, talent, and startups with industry [Homepage; Research; TEC link].

Scale and outcomes are a key differentiator: 15,000+ students from all 50 U.S. states and 100+ countries; 600+ faculty; $300M in annual research expenditures; 150+ labs/centers; 42 top‑ten ranked degree programs/specialties; and 100,000+ alumni worldwide [About; Facts & Rankings]. The college is named for alumnus William W. Grainger; The Grainger Foundation has contributed $300M+—the largest gift ever to name a public engineering college—supporting scholarships, facilities, endowed chairs, and research [About].

Beyond Urbana-Champaign, the college runs significant initiatives in Chicago, aiming to accelerate the region’s tech ecosystem in quantum and AI. Partnerships include the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago (with Northwestern and UChicago), the Chicago Quantum Exchange (with UChicago, Argonne, Fermilab, and others), Discovery Partners Institute, and Duality (quantum startup accelerator). The Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park (IQMP)—with partners like PsiQuantum, IBM, the State of Illinois, and DARPA—projects up to $20B in economic impact. Chicago engagement includes 63 corporate partners and 440 City Scholars student placements; the Illini Center is located at 200 S. Wacker Dr., Chicago [About/Chicago].

Recent highlights underscore depth and breadth of impact:
- First Illinois‑led NASA spacecraft mission (Carruthers Geocorona Observatory) launched Sept 2025 [Homepage news].
- Collaboration with Meta and Amrize to develop an AI model optimizing concrete mixes for data centers (strength, speed, sustainability) [Homepage news].
- Thought leadership and industry connections spanning nuclear energy, semiconductors (e.g., TSMC), and advanced materials [Homepage news].

Headquarters and contact: 306 Engineering Hall MC 266, 1308 W. Green St., Urbana, IL 61801; +1 217‑333‑2280; engineering@illinois.edu [News/Contact]. A Chicago presence supports corporate and research partnerships [About/Chicago].

Distinctive value propositions include unmatched scale and rankings, research depth across priority areas (sustainability, energy, quantum, AI), extensive corporate partnerships, a leading entrepreneurship ecosystem, and a proven pipeline of high-performing graduates (BS starting salary avg. ~$93,250) [About; Facts & Rankings].
