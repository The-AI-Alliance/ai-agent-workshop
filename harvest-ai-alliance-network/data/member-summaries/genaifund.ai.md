## GenAI Fund — Organization Summary

GenAI Fund is an early-stage investor and ecosystem builder focused on AI-first technology companies in Southeast Asia. It invests as early as possible and actively works with founders from day one on product, market, and technology strategy, aiming to build enduring companies that create real market impact using AI (source: homepage).

Beyond investing, the firm runs corporate innovation programs and advisory for enterprises, governments, and institutions to accelerate real-world AI adoption. Its offerings span structured innovation (hackathons, venture building, accelerators, corporate VC playbooks), AI use-case workshops, solution sourcing and matchmaking, startup and technical due diligence, proof-of-concept (PoC) execution and implementation support, and go-to-market strategy (homepage).

GenAI Fund also equips ecosystem leaders with education and insight—executive masterclasses and research—most notably through the ASEAN GenAI Startup Report, produced with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The 2024 report was based on research of 700+ GenAI startups across ASEAN and launched via a six-country roadshow featuring 50+ speakers and 2,000+ attendees, with participation from AWS and Databricks and contributions from organizations such as AI Verify Foundation, MDEC (Malaysia), Vietnam’s National Innovation Center (NIC), Antler, Capria, Do Ventures, DS/X Ventures, Jungle Ventures, Kaya Founders, Lightspeed, and Wavemaker (ASEAN GenAI Report page).

On the capital side, GenAI Fund provides curated AI startup deal flow, co-investment and corporate VC support, investment strategy and CVC advisory, LP syndication and fund collaboration, and M&A scouting and exit planning (homepage). Its FastTrack AI Accelerator is a 12-week program (applications open for Cohort 2) culminating in a Demo Day to showcase startup–enterprise PoC outcomes; the program is supported by an application and matching platform (app.genaifund.ai) (FastTrack page).

Flagship initiatives include:
- ASEAN GenAI Startup Report (with AWS), launched via a six-country roadshow (Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta, Hanoi).
- GenAI Open Innovation (2025 Vietnam edition), aligning enterprise needs with startup solutions across HR, financial services, customer operations, ESG, construction safety, retail execution, logistics, internal ops, and more, with detailed “What Enterprise Need” briefs for PoC scoping (Open Innovation page).
- FastTrack AI Accelerator, connecting startups with enterprises for implementation-focused pilots over 12 weeks (FastTrack page).

The fund’s team includes Partners Laura Nguyen, Denning Tan, and Kai Yong Kang; CFO Magdalene Choong; and Head of Programs Eugene Koon. Advisors and venture partners include AWS ASEAN’s Head of Technology for GenAI & Digital Native (Girish Patil), Diana Gan, Gian Paulo dela Rama, Amarit Charoenphan, Dr. Tuan Q. Phan, Tha Toe Htoon, and My Nguyen (Team page). While Southeast Asia is the primary focus, the firm notes a global mindset from day one, engaging with startups, enterprises, and government officials across multiple countries (homepage).
