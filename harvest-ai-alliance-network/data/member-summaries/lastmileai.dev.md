## LastMile AI (lastmileai.dev) — Company Overview

LastMile AI is an early-stage AI company focused on building a “cognitive computer,” a new horizontal software substrate (a cognitive OS) that uses generative AI to perceive, remember, reason, act, and interact across a user’s tools and services. Their vision centers on replacing today’s siloed, vertical “AI for X” applications with a shared, permission-aware context and orchestration layer that powers personalized intelligence for individuals, teams, and entire organizations.

Core concept and platform direction:
- Cognitive OS: Treats LLMs as the “CPU,” context as RAM, long-term memory as storage, and connectors as drivers to tools, services, applications, and base OS.
- Core services: Contextual memory, orchestration, authentication, and just-in-time UX (chat, form, email, voice).
- Horizontal foundation: Provides a shared cognitive layer across functions (e.g., on-call, scheduling, marketing, operations), eliminating manual context switching and fragmented workflows common in vertical AI tools.
- Personalization at scale: Envisions a system that adapts to the individual (“chief of staff”), coordinates teams (“program manager”), and serves as an organizational “nervous system.”

Leadership and team:
- CEO: Sarmad Qadri
- CTO: Bill Peterson
- CPO & President: Andrew Hoh
- Additional team members across product design, growth, research, and engineering are listed on the Careers page.

Mission and vision:
- “Build a cognitive computer to empower people, teams and organizations.”
- “A cognitive computer everywhere for everyone.”
- Framed as the next era in computing—after mainframe, PC, and mobile/cloud—adding “cognition” as a core building block.

Company principles and culture (from Careers):
- Always be shipping; tight feedback loops with users.
- Embrace iteration and learning; make bold bets.
- Go the extra mile to delight customers.
- Transparent interview process; competitive benefits (salary + equity, medical/dental/vision, 401k/RRSP, commuter benefits, PTO).

Content and thought leadership:
- Blog example: “LLM Hallucination Detection for Real-World RAG, Part I” (Mar 12, 2024), indicating work on reliability in applied LLM/RAG systems.

Customers and industries (implied focus):
- Knowledge workers and organizations requiring cross-tool orchestration and permission-aware context.
- Applicable across domains where fragmented SaaS, APIs, and data sources impede productivity.

Distinctive aspects:
- Strong architectural stance on a “cognitive OS” that unifies context and action across tools (horizontal approach vs. vertical AI apps).
- Emphasis on perfect/permission-aware context and task orchestration, designed to reduce manual “human middleware” across systems.
- Early-stage team with named leadership and an explicit, ambitious long-term computing vision.
