## Dartmouth College — Organization Summary

Dartmouth College is a private research university with a liberal arts core that educates promising students for a lifetime of learning and responsible leadership, through faculty dedicated to teaching and the creation of knowledge (Mission). Founded in 1769, Dartmouth combines small, intensive learning environments with broad research opportunities across more than 40 departments and programs in the School of Arts & Sciences, and through its graduate and professional schools: Geisel School of Medicine, Thayer School of Engineering, Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate & Advanced Studies.

Academic offerings emphasize interdisciplinary study, person-to-person teaching, and hands-on research. Dartmouth highlights a 7:1 undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio, with most classes enrolling 20 or fewer students; 60% of undergraduates engage in research and 80% participate in internships. The university supports scholarship via more than 75 centers and institutes and the Dartmouth Library’s 2+ million volumes. Education spans campus and the world, with faculty and students pursuing projects “at every latitude and time zone.”

Dartmouth’s core values include academic excellence; independence of thought within a collaborative culture; a commitment to teaching and cutting-edge scholarship; embracing diversity and recruiting outstanding students regardless of financial means; fostering integrity and community; and supporting vigorous, respectful debate. The institution is situated in the Upper Connecticut River Valley, with a 269-acre main campus and a vibrant regional arts and outdoor environment.

Leadership is headed by President Sian Leah Beilock (Dartmouth’s 19th president and first woman in the role), with Provost Santiago Schnell and senior leaders overseeing academic and administrative strategy. School leaders include Deans Duane A. Compton (Geisel), Douglas Van Citters (Interim, Thayer), F. Jon Kull (Guarini), and Matthew J. Slaughter (Tuck). Dartmouth’s “Dartmouth Dialogues” initiative expands programming to foster conversations and skills that bridge political and personal divides, and the campus regularly hosts high-profile events such as a United Nations Well-Being Symposium.
