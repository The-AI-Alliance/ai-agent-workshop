## monday.com — Company Profile

monday.com is a publicly traded work operating system (Work OS) that helps organizations plan, execute, and track work across departments with built‑in AI, no‑code automations, and 300+ integrations. The platform has evolved into a multi‑product suite—spanning work management, sales CRM, service management, marketing, and product/development—designed to drive execution at scale with resource visibility and AI‑powered risk detection.

Founded by Roy Mann and Eran Zinman after experiencing the pain of coordinating fast‑growing teams, monday.com launched from Tel Aviv and in June 2021 listed on Nasdaq. The company continues to expand globally and invest in product innovation (e.g., monday apps and Work OS, monday AI Assistant, regional data residency in Australia).

AI-first approach across the suite
- Embedded where teams work (no separate tools), with:
  - AI actions and code‑free automations to clear busywork.
  - AI risk flagging, triage, routing, and guidance.
  - AI‑powered workflows, best‑practice templates, and reporting to keep projects on track.
- Security and data handling (as presented by the company for AI features): AI is designed to be transparent and controlled; partners are required to delete customer data after each query and not train on customer data.
