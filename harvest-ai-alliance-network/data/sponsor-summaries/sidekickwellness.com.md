## Sidekick Wellness — Company Profile

Sidekick Wellness builds the Sidekick Platform, an AI system designed to augment—not replace—human expertise. The platform lets experts, organizational leaders/program managers, and end users each operate a dedicated, purpose-built “AI Sidekick” that works in concert with the others. These synchronized Sidekicks continuously communicate to align goals, share insights, and improve outcomes across wellness, education, and broader human potential use cases.
