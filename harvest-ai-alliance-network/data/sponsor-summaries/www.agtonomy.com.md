Summary
Agtonomy is a California-based software and services company that embeds “physical AI” and autonomous capabilities into off‑road equipment to automate routine tasks for agriculture and land management. Factory‑integrated with leading OEMs and implement makers, the Agtonomy Platform (formerly TeleFarmer) provides planning, remote monitoring, fleet intelligence, and autonomy across mixed fleets (diesel and electric), enabling growers and land managers to handle jobs such as mowing, spraying, weeding, hauling, and transport.

Core focus and offerings
- Physical AI and autonomy platform: End‑to‑end planning, execution, and analytics for mixed fleets; unified operator app to plan tasks, monitor live status, and review performance (Homepage; About).
- Infrastructure‑free autonomy: Vision-based navigation with embedded connectivity (cellular + Starlink), no pre‑mapping or local base stations; designed for day‑one turnkey autonomous operations (Press: Third‑Generation Platform, 4/16/25).
- Fleet intelligence: AI‑driven management that allows a single operator to manage 10+ tractors, with expanding equipment support (including Bobcat CT4045) and broader environments (orchards, vineyards, fields, turf/green spaces) (Press: Third‑Generation Platform, 4/16/25).
- Smart Farm Task Ecosystem: Hardware + software that digitally connects tractors and implements for autonomous task execution:
  - Smart Take‑Off (STO), Smart Toolbar, Smart Implement Sensors (SIS), Smart Sprayers (Press: Autonomous Task Ecosystem, 2/14/24).
- Deployment and adoption programs: Paid pilot and rental programs to “try before you buy,” expanding to Washington and other regions, with grower partners including E & J Gallo, Treasury Wine Estates, Silver Oak, and Caymus (Press: Pilot Program Expansion, 2/12/24; Rental Program – Washington, 12/5/24).
