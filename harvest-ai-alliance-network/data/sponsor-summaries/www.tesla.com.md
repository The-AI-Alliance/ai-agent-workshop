I attempted to crawl tesla.com (homepage, About, Careers, Investor Relations, and AI pages), but the site’s robots.txt returns 403 and blocks automated access, so I couldn’t directly view or quote content from tesla.com. If you can provide specific URLs to fetch via your UI’s manual fetch, or paste key pages, I can extract details precisely from the website. Alternatively, I can proceed using other authoritative sources (e.g., SEC filings, reputable news) on request.

Below is a concise organizational overview based on well-established public information (not scraped from tesla.com due to access restrictions).

Summary
Tesla, Inc. is a vertically integrated sustainable energy and technology company focused on:
- Electric vehicles (EVs): Designing and manufacturing passenger cars (Model S, 3, X, Y), Cybertruck, and Tesla Semi, with a software‑defined vehicle approach and frequent over‑the‑air (OTA) updates.
- Energy generation and storage: Residential and utility‑scale products including Powerwall, Megapack, and solar panels/Solar Roof; project development and grid services with utilities and commercial partners.
- Charging infrastructure: The Supercharger network and the North American Charging Standard (NACS), which many automakers have committed to adopt, expanding charging interoperability.
- Autonomy and AI: Advanced driver assistance (Autopilot, Full Self‑Driving), in‑house AI training infrastructure (Dojo), and ongoing robotics research (e.g., Optimus).
- Manufacturing scale: Global Gigafactories in the U.S., China, and Germany, enabling high‑volume production, vertical integration (including battery tech), and cost efficiencies.

Mission and positioning:
- Mission: Accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
- Target customers: Consumers, fleets, utilities, energy developers, and commercial/industrial customers.
- Value propositions: Integrated EV + energy ecosystem, proprietary software/AI stack, Supercharger access, vertical integration, and rapid OTA innovation.

Organization and footprint:
- Headquarters: Austin, Texas, USA.
- Regions served: Global sales, service, and charging footprint across North America, Europe, and Asia.
- Leadership: CEO Elon Musk.
