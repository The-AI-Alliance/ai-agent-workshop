Below is a concise, source-grounded profile of Faction Technology, Inc., based on a crawl of faction.us (Homepage, Company, Tech, Blog, Careers, Contact).

Company overview
Faction Technology, Inc. develops supervised driverless solutions for light electric vehicle (micro-EV) fleets focused on last‑mile delivery and commercial operations. Its approach combines baseline autonomy with a trajectory-based remote assistance system (“TeleAssist”) to achieve practical, cost‑effective deployment now, rather than pursuing 100% autonomy. Faction provides an end‑to‑end platform—vehicle enablement (DriveLink), fleet management, customer portals, and APIs—that integrates with enterprise order and fleet systems to support delivery, logistics, and other controlled-environment operations.

Core focus and offerings
- Supervised autonomy stack
  - DriveLink: Digital vehicle platform enabling safety‑critical autonomy features and over‑the‑air updates; supports networked data and micromobility form factors (Tech page).
  - TeleAssist: Remote human assistance engaged on edge cases via a trajectory‑based assist system (Tech page; Company page).
- Fleet & customer software
  - Cloud fleet management with real‑time mission tracking, driverless status, route completion, telemetry, and KPI dashboards; integrates with order management systems; customer portals and APIs (Tech page; Homepage).
- Vehicles and deployment model
  - Emphasis on right‑sized, zero‑emission, lightweight electric vehicles; phased deployment methodology from safety-driver mapping to gradual roll‑out of driverless operations (Homepage).

Industries and target customers
- Industries highlighted: controlled environments (e.g., airfields, secure closed-course commercial areas), grocery, quick-serve/fast food, and commercial fleets (Homepage).
- Target customers: enterprises running delivery/logistics fleets, retailers/food service, operators of controlled environments, and vehicle OEMs seeking to embed driverless capabilities (Homepage; Tech page; Blog).

Unique value propositions
- Pragmatic driverless approach: hybrid of autonomy + remote TeleAssist to accelerate deployment and reduce cost (Company; Tech; Homepage).
- End‑to‑end solution: vehicle enablement + fleet management + APIs for seamless enterprise integration (Homepage; Tech).
- Cost and scalability: claims include enabling driverless solutions at under $2/mile; current Faction-enabled platforms < ~$35k, and < ~$15k per‑vehicle integration for OEMs (Blog: “commercial expansion of DriveLink and TeleAssist,” Feb 27, 2023).
- Right‑sized micro‑EVs: lower-carbon, efficient vehicles for urban deliveries and short trips (Homepage).
