I couldn’t crawl https://www.aica-gj.kr/ because the site presents an anti-bot verification page (“Please prove that you are human”) and blocks automated access, including the robots.txt and English pages.

If you can share specific URLs or page content (copy/paste, PDFs, or screenshots), I can analyze them and deliver a precise summary. Alternatively, with your permission, I can compile a profile using other official/public sources (and clearly cite them).

How to proceed
- Easiest: Send me the text or PDFs of key pages (About, Services/Programs, News, Contact, Organization).
- Or authorize use of reputable external sources (e.g., government press releases, industry associations, public filings), and I’ll produce a fully cited profile.
- If you administer the site: temporarily whitelist my access or provide a bypass token, and I can crawl directly.

Once I have access to content, I will return the following in Markdown:

- Summary: 
  - What the organization is/does, core focus, whom it serves, regions covered, and its mission/vision.
  - Key programs/services and any scale metrics or differentiators.
  - Notable partnerships or announcements.

- Bullet list of most relevant data points:
  - Official name:
  - Entity type (e.g., agency, association, nonprofit):
  - Mission/vision (verbatim if stated):
  - Core services/programs:
  - Target customers/industries:
  - Distinctive value propositions (e.g., facilities, funding, infra):
  - Partnerships/alliances:
  - Headquarters/regions served:
  - Leadership/contacts (if public):
  - Latest news/milestones:
  - Website subpages of record (About, Programs, News, Contact):
  - Contact info and social channels:

If you prefer, reply with “Use external sources” and I’ll compile a cited profile from publicly available, authoritative materials.
