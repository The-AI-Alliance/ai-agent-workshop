I couldn’t crawl english.seoul.go.kr because the site’s robots.txt disallows autonomous access for non-whitelisted crawlers (it only allows major search-engine bots). If you can share specific URLs or page content (copy/paste or files), I can analyze them. Alternatively, with your permission, I can compile a profile using other official/public sources (e.g., archived pages, press releases, or reputable references) and clearly cite them.

In the meantime, here is a concise, general overview of the organization (not sourced from the blocked site, but from widely known public information about the city government):
