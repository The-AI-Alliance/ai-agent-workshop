Below is a concise profile of Devz AI Technologies, based on a crawl of its public site.

Summary
Devz AI Technologies is a U.S.-based software company offering an AI-powered platform that supports the full product lifecycle—from idea incubation to development and ongoing operations. Its suite comprises:
- Dreamer: AI-generated business and technical plans to make ideas “business ready.”
- Forge: An AI-augmented development service that requires no technical background, generating requirements and project plans, enabling real-time progress tracking, on‑platform user acceptance testing (UAT), AI-powered testing/deployment, and a warranty guarantee; clients pay only after approving deliverables.
- Sentry: An AI-driven operations and incident management solution featuring 24/7 monitoring and response, an adaptive AI assistant (“Devi”), real-time incident tracking, dynamic 3D service maps, dashboards, and integrations with common DevOps/ITSM tools.

Devz targets individuals, startups, small businesses, and enterprises that need a simpler, faster path to plan, build, and operate software products (websites, mobile apps, BI tools, and AI models). The company emphasizes “software made simple using AI” with flexible payment options (subscription or pay-as-you-go). The Dreamer product uses a credit model (e.g., 50 credits = $10; basic plan generation costs 5 credits; premium plan generation costs 50 credits using proprietary data). Operational support includes a dedicated incident manager and a <15‑minute response time commitment.

Distinctive aspects include an end-to-end AI approach (planning → build → operate), on-platform UAT with pay-on-approval and warranty guarantee, an AI operations assistant (Devi), dynamic 3D service maps, and turnkey integrations (PagerDuty, Slack, Okta, ServiceNow, Jira). Devz AI Technologies Inc. lists its address as 325 Paradiso, Irvine, CA 92602, USA.
