## Asana — Company Profile

Asana is a leading work management platform for human + AI collaboration. Built to bring clarity and accountability to complex work, Asana helps organizations connect strategic goals to execution, coordinate cross‑functional programs, and keep teams aligned—with AI working alongside humans to move work forward. More than 170,000 customers, including Accenture, Amazon, Anthropic, Suzuki, and 85% of the Fortune 100 (free + paid, as of Dec 2023), use Asana to plan, track, and deliver outcomes at scale. The company is headquartered in San Francisco and operates globally across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

Founded by Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein, Asana originated from the founders’ experience leading fast‑growing engineering teams at Facebook, where “work about work” (meetings, email, searching for info) impeded progress. They developed a tool to coordinate work clearly and efficiently, later establishing Asana to help teams worldwide “do great work—without the busywork.” The company’s mission is to help humanity thrive by enabling the world’s teams to work together effortlessly.
