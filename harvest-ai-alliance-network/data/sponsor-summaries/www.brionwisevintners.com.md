Philosophy and approach
- Vineyard-first, site-specific focus: The organization seeks “that rare intersection” of exceptional vineyard sites and the work of singular people to craft wines of the highest caliber.
- Preservation of independence: When adding storied labels such as Mark Herold Wines and Amapola Creek (Richard Arrowood), Brion Wise Vintners emphasizes maintaining each brand’s independent nature and character.
- Quality as paramount: A “dynamic complexity” guides the portfolio—but quality remains the top consideration across all projects.
