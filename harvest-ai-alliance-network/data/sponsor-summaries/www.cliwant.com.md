Here is an authoritative, concise profile of Cliwant (Proact) based on a crawl of its public site.

Summary
Cliwant (brand: Proact) is an OpenAI Partner startup that uses AI to accelerate teaming for government contracting. It connects verified prime contractors (with a focus on set‑aside small businesses) and capable subcontractors, and actively books meetings to pursue federal, state, and local (SLED) opportunities together.

Its AI analyzes five years of verified award data across 180,000+ industry codes (NAICS, PSC, UNSPSC) to identify target agencies, shortlist compatible primes, and generate partner intelligence. Unlike data-only tools, Proact combines algorithmic matching with a human team that pre‑qualifies partners, guides first meetings, and helps both sides align to win real deals.

The company reports 3+ average monthly meetings per client, 110,943+ teaming‑ready set‑aside primes, and a base of hundreds of active subcontractor clients. It sponsors APMP (the Association of Proposal Management Professionals) and notes recognition as an OpenAI Partner Startup and participation in Google AI Academy. Proact operates globally with offices in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Singapore, and Korea; its stated mission is to make government contracting more accessible.
